# Ikaros2D

A game engine for HAL event project. Designed for rendering 2D sprites in 3D world (Parallax Scrolling). Uses similar structure to unity so team members can work on their own code without interfering with main loop. All object instances are recorded in vectors and handled by engine core. Uses pointers instead of references so extra care is required!
